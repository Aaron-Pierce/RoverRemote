# Installation

All you need are the required dependencies.

`pip3 install inputs`

or

`python3 -m install inputs`

# Configuration

udp_mc_drive.conf contains the configuration information.
The send ip and port are detected already by the program, and only exist because they did in the last version.
You don't have to mess with them, and they aren't read in the code
